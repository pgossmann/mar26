# Angular Chatbot Demo

This repository provides a very small Angular example that implements a streaming chat interface.

The Angular project lives in [`angular-chat/`](angular-chat/). It contains the basic application files and a `ChatService` that sends user messages and contextual data to a backend endpoint and streams back text chunks from a language model.

See [`angular-chat/README.md`](angular-chat/README.md) for instructions on running and building the project.
